theonering.js
=============

Three Languages for the Hairy-kings under the San Francisco sky,
Seven for the C#-lords in their halls of silicon,
Nine for Mortal Bros doomed to die,
One for the Dark Eich on his dark throne
In the Land of ##Javascript where the Coders lie.

One Language to rule them all, One Language to find them,
One Language to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
In the Land of ##Javascript where the Coders lie.
